        "attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, "
        "chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with "
        "COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. \n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission "
        "is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from "
        "infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your "
